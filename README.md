# Subregular experiments

This notebook and general evaluation pipeline was adapted from code written for and used in Chapter 3 of Aksënova (2020). All code in the first few sections was taken verbatim from https://github.com/alenaks/subregular-experiments. The section 'Experiment 10: Multi-tier Input-Sensitive Harmony' was taken from De Santo & Aksënova (2021), with code taken verbatim from https://github.com/alenaks/2IMTSL. The MITSL Experiments section was adapted from Aksënova (2020), by changing to use a MITSL implemented in local_sigmapie/code/mitsl_class.py, which is the main contribution for this work and was adapted from the rest of the code. The python classes in local_sigmapie are needed to run this notebook, as are the natural language corpora files in the natural_data folder.
